This is a simple powershell command line tool for parsing information from the docker inspect tool without having to sift through the JSON object or remembering all the fields just to an IP address for a container.   

Dont think this will get any other pulls other than myself, but if you find this usefull and want to help out in any way, please shoot me an email at robertpratt.bp@outlook.com and we can coordinate.

Thanks and have a great day!
